# ✨✨ Hola! Ixel here (pronounced "ee-shell") ✨✨ 

I am an early career data scientist excited to apply my skills in ecology, conservation, and restoration to support a sustainable world. I value creativity and strong collaborations across fields to develop progressive environmental solutions and management strategies. I hope to bring inclusivity to the data science field.
